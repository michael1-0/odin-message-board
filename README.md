# odin-message-board

This is a project submission for The Odin Project Node Course, Project: Mini Message Board.

The goal of this project is to familiarize myself even more into Node.js ecosystem using Express, EJS; how to handle routing, middlewares as controllers, errors and viewing with EJS.

To recreate locally, clone this project and install the dependencies, then simply run `npm run server`.
